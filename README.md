**WIP**

Contains a Jupyter notebook demo for `monad-bayes` and `prob-fx` in Idris 2.

After cloning this repository and its submodules:

1) Make sure [`idris2-jupyter`](https://github.com/min-nguyen/idris2-jupyter) is installed by following its README instructions.

2) Run the following to open up a Jupyter interface from the `bayes` project directory.
    ```
    cd bayes
    ../idris2-jupyter/run/jupyter_run.sh
    ```
   Then open `LinRegr.ipynb` from the interface.
